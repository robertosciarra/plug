plug php-mvc-rad was born with simplicity in mind and as a non-framework code to avoid the overkill of the biggest framework on very small projects. But adding one utility after another, it has become a framework anyway. Fast, simple and reliable tries to take the best from the "bigger brothers" without overcomplicating the most simple things.
